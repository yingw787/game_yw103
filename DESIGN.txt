Genre of Game: 
Puzzle + Scrolling Platformer

Name and Backstory: 
Mario the Minesweeper 

Mario gets sucked into a minefield somehow, and must jump on squares in order to escape the minefield. 
Then he is chased by a giant lava field that is following him for some reason, and he must escape as fast as he can. 
Will he make it back to Mario World? Or will he get blown up and respawn at the castle? (Seems a lot easier IMHO) 

Goal: 

Mark the mines 
Figure out where the non-mined areas are 
Get to the other side of the map 
Escape the giant lava field that's following you


Basic Mechanics: 

Move using arrow keys 
Mark mines using right click 
Click on squares using left click 


Description of modes and levels:
- Easy: short path, few mines  
- Medium: medium path, some mines 
- Hard: long path, lots of mines  

- Set path: fixed length path with timer to count down how fast Mario gets to the entrance; fail if die 
- Lava: fixed length path, lava comes after some time and Mario must get to the entrance; pass or fail
- Survival(maybe?): lava wall coming towards you, Mario has to run for as long as possible, timer keeps score
