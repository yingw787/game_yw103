Impressions/Suggestions: I feel like a puzzle game like the one I built involved a lot of class interaction; I think most other people did a lot of shape collision detection and sequential stuff within a stage. I think I can apply what I learned about class interaction to other projects more so than collision detection, which is partially why I chose it, but it takes a bit longer especially if you're extending a class and are not familiar with it.
